# Hickathon3

This repository is specially created for `Hickathon 3` competition held by `Hi!Paris`. 

In general, it has a pre-training phase (2022.11.21 - 2023.1.13), during which some tutorials would be given. You can find them [here](Tutorials). The tutorials include **Data cleaning, Feature engineering, model training, optimazition, explainability and Deep learning**.

I found these tuto of high quality. Moreover, it provides a **general view of code style and of pipeline in industry**.

You can find some summarized interesting points in tutorials [here](Interesting%20points.md).
